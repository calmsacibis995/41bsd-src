Last update: Jan 1980

	The sources here represent a major update of the f77 i/o library.
In almost all cases routines conform to the ANSI standard. The only known
exceptions are the "print" file form in `open' and `inquire', and the "+"
vertical format control (still not implemented). Often relaxations or
extensions of the standard have been incorporated.
See the writeup file for details of the new library.

	The non-ANSI extensions can be eliminated from the library by
changing the Makefile to compile with -DKOSHER.

	There may be some minor incompatabilities between the Vax 'C' compiler
and 'C' on other machines that may cause problems with this code. The default
definition of 'int' for example. I don't expect it to be a major problem.
Please do send WELL DOCUMENTED bug reports to me.

	A modified I/O code generation routine for the compiler is included
in this directory. It include 2 compile time options. One option affects
the handling of the iostat= clause: unless compiled with -DKOSHER or
-DIOSRETURN an iostat= clause by itself will not cause a return on any
error. Return is made only if one of the err= or end= clauses is present.
The other option, suppressed with -DKOSHER, is that end= is allowed in write
statements.  This copy of 'io.c' is included on the distribution tape.

To use the tape:
	1. Load, using tar, into an appropriate directory. This is basically
	   the source for libI77 so /usr/src/libI77 would be appropriate.

	2. Link or copy or move 'io.c' into the source directory for f77pass1.
	   Usually /usr/src/cmd/f77.
	   NOTE Jan, 1980: This may be /usr/src/cmd/f77/vaxvax

	3. 'make f77pass1', 'make install' while in the /f77 directory.

	4. Return to the /libI77 directory. 'make lib' if necessary.
	   Otherwise 'make install' to put the new lib in place.

	5. If you modify the writeup.tx file, you can 'make writeup' to
	   create the nroff'ed version.
