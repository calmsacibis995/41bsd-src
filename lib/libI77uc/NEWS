	Update info on the f77 I/O lib.

01 Feb, 1980
   All instances of:
	if(!init) f_init();
   have been removed. f_init() is called from main.c on startup in the new
   libF77.a .

   Backspace now allows non-seek files to reset the EOF flag.

   The way SIGINT is handled in libF77/main.c has been changed.
   If the signal is not SIG_DFL, it is left alone as otherwise the
   program will be killed if run in the background and the user types DEL.
   The signal trap that used to be in the I/O lib has been removed.

   The ANSI fortran standard requires that I/O routines return to the caller
   on any error condition if iostat= is specified even if no err= or end=
   trap is specified. The implication of this is that the program must
   be prepared to deal with ALL I/O errors if iostat= is specified.
   If only one trap is specified, end= for example, the program must test the
   iostat variable for positive/non-zero after the I/O call since return
   will occur on any error. This seems awkward and I've chosen to make this
   feature optional. I am interested in other views on this.
   
   In the current version of the compiler (using the modified io.c),
   iostat= is used only to return status information from
   I/O calls but does not itself cause return on any I/O error. Only
   the traps, err= and end=, will cause a return/branch, and only for
   the specified trap(s).
   
   This feature has been made a compile time option in the current version
   of (modified) io.c It implements the standard correctly if compiled
   with -DKOSHER or -DIOSRETURN. Otherwise it executes as currently
   implemented.

   As originally implemented the '$' specification caused a NULL to be
   output (inplace of the \n) Actually NULL's should never appear in the
   formatted output streams. Therefore in "sfe.c" in x_putc() and pr_put()
   add      if (c)      before the instances of      putc(c,cf)

   Spaces (ASCII 040) do not have significance in FORMAT statements except
   within strings. In order to accomodate old programs that may have
   arbitrary occurances of spaces, all spaces are now ignored. Thus the
   format ( 1 0 X , 1 2 F 1 0 . 4 / ) is accepted.

12 May, 1980
   A bug in handling partially filled "unformatted direct" records has been
   fixed by ensuring that all records are complete when written. The bug was
   that the last record of such a file would cause EOF if a read was attempted
   for a full record. Existing files of this form should be "fixed" by
   reading and rewriting the last record using the new version of libI77.a

12 May, 1980
   BACKSPACE will now open a default file (fort.N) if the specified logical
   unit is not open. REWIND and other I/O already did this. CLOSE and
   ENDFILE do not open a default file.

07 Oct, 1980
   List directed input now terminates properly on a slash and flushes to
   either slash or newline, whichever comes first. List directed input now
   properly converts wierd forms such as 3.-4 and 5+3. It now returns an
   error if the repeat count is negative.

   Several type definitions were changed/added to accomodate 11/70's.
