The links between Ing70-IngVAX, Ing70-CSVAX, A-C, C-D, B-D, and C-E run
at 9600 Baud, all others run at 1200 Baud.  There is a file-length limit
of 100,000 bytes (500,000 bytes between the two Ingres machines).
Larger files must be split up (use the split command).

Free Commands (log in as user "network", no password):

	bpq		news		vpq		yank
	epq		ps		w
	finger 		pstat		wc
	help		rcs		where
	lpq		rcslog		who
	netlog		rcsq		whom
	netq		trq		write		

In addition, the "lpr" command is free on the Ingres machines.
Sending mail between machines, and netlpr between the Computer Center machines
is free.  On the EECS40, there are no free commands (but sending mail is free).
The netlpr command to Cory will allow the -c option to "epr" and "bpr",
and to the CSVAX will allow "vpr".

Mail complaints, etc. to "csvax:schmidt".
