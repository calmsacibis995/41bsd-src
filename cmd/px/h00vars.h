/*
 * px - Berkeley Pascal interpreter
 *
 * Version 2.0, January 1979
 *
 * Original version by Ken Thompson
 *
 * Substantial revisions by Bill Joy and Chuck Haley
 * November-December 1976
 *
 * Rewritten for VAX 11/780 by Kirk McKusick
 * Fall 1978
 *
 * Px is described in detail in the "PX 1.0 Implementation Notes"
 * The source code for px is in several major pieces:
 *
 *	int.c		C main program which reads in interpreter code
 *	00case.s	Driver including main interpreter loop
 *	dd*.s		Where dd are digits, interpreter instructions
 *			grouped by their positions in the interpreter table.
 *	p*.c		Various C language routines supporting the system.
 *
 * In addition there are several headers defining mappings for error
 * messages names into codes, and a definition of the interpreter transfer
 * table. These are made by the script Emake in this directory and the scripts
 * in the directory '../opcodes'.

 * The file i/o routines maintain a notion of a "current file".
 * The printing name of this file is kept in the variable
 * "file" for use in error messages.

/*
 * THE RUNTIME DISPLAY
 *
 * The entries in the display point to the active static block marks.
 * The first entry in the display is for the global variables,
 * then the procedure or function at level one, etc.
 * Each display entry points to a stack frame as shown:
 *
 *		base of stack frame
 *		  ---------------
 *		  |		|
 *		  | block mark  |
 *		  |		|
 *		  ---------------  <-- display entry points here
 *		  |             |
 *		  |   local	|
 *		  |  variables  |
 *		  |		|
 *		  ---------------
 *		  |		|
 *		  |  expression |
 *		  |  temporary  |
 *		  |  storage	|
 *		  |		|
 *		  - - - - - - - -
 *
 * The information in the block mark is thus at positive offsets from
 * the display pointer entries while the local variables are at negative
 * offsets. The block mark actually consists of two parts. The first
 * part is created at CALL and the second at entry, i.e. BEGIN. Thus:
 *
 *		-------------------------
 *		|			|
 *		|  Saved lino		|
 *		|  Saved lc		|
 *		|  Saved dp		|
 *		|			|
 *		-------------------------
 *		|			|
 *		|  Saved (dp)		|
 *		|			|
 *		|  Current section name	|
 *		|   and entry line ptr	|
 *		|			|
 *		|  Saved file name and	|
 *		|   file buffer ptr	|
 *		|			|
 *		|  Empty tos value	|
 *		|			|
 *		-------------------------
