The writing tools package contains 3 command files,
	style, diction, and explain.
``style'' reads a document and analyzes the surface
	characteristics of the writing style of the document.
``diction'' locates all sentences in a document containing
	commonly misused or wordy phrases.
``explain'' is an interactive thesaures for the phrases found by diction.

The manual pages are in files style.1 and diction.1 - see the enclosed documentation
	for more details.

``style'' is a runcom that runs 4 programs, style1, style2, style3, and deroff.
	style1, style2, style3 are included on the tape, you should not need to
	make them, but if you do -

To make style1, style2, style3:
	set BIN in Makefile to the directory where the object files
		are to be stored.
	then run ``make style''
	in the file ``style'' set B to the same directory as BIN above.

``diction'' is a runcom that runs 2 programs, dprog and deroff.
	dprog has been included on the tape, but you will need to make it
	to include the full path name of dict.d

To make dprog:
	set DICT in Makefile to the full path name of diction's data
		file ``dict.d''
	the program ``dprog'' will get put in the same place as
		the object files for style (BIN).
	then run ``make diction''
	the file ``diction'' also needs B set to the same directory as BIN
		above

The file ``explain'' needs D set to the full path name of the file
	explain.d

Both ``style'' and ``diction'' expect the document to contain formatting
	commands.  A new version of deroff is included that knows about
	the standard UNIX formatting macro packages.
	the command ``make deroff'' will install deroff in BIN mentioned
	above.  You may wish to install this version of deroff in /usr/bin
	in which case the path names to it in files ``style'' and
	``diction'' should be changed accordingly.

The default flag passed to deroff (either -ms or -ml) in both
	style and diction should be set to the proper one for your installation.

These programs will not compile under UNIX version 6 or PWB 1.2 due
	to size limitations on these systems.
