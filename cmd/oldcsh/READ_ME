This shell needs a printf which prints through putchar like it used to.
The printf.c in this dir hacks one from the stdio printf without dragging
in all the stdio stuff.  It should work on most systems which only have stdio.
Some early versions of stdio have a "strout" whose first 2 arguments are
reversed.  Check this before you run the shell.

The getpw*.c stuff here is simply to keep from dragging in all the data space
from the stdio stuff (an input buffer, output buffer, file structs, etc)
since the shell does its own i/o anyways because of the way
it parses in loops.  If you don't care about more data space you dont need
to take these.

For the debugging "alloc" command to work it needs to work its
way through the alloc list.  A modified version of alloc which does this
is in this directory.  If you wish you can simply get rid of the "alloc"
command and not define "debug" in makefile.

For the shell to coexist with another shell you can define OTHERSH
in sh.local.h as, e.g. "/bin/sh".  If a file which purports to be a shell
script doesn't start with a `#' this other shell interprets it.
If necessary a longer string than just `#' could easily be used.
If OTHERSH is not defined then this hack doesn't occur.
For full sanity complementary code should be placed in OTHERSH!

Look at sh.local.h for other things which you may need/want to change.
