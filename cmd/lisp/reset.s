# C library -- reset, setexit
#	reset(x)
# will generate a "return" from
# the last call to
#	setexit()
# by restoring r6 - r12, ap, fp
# and doing a return.
# The returned value is x; on the original
# call the returned value is 0.
#
# useful for going back to the main loop
# after a horrible error in a lowlevel
# routine.
# Changed by M. Marcus (4/4/80) to chain saved frames.  Should be rewritten
# to only use the stack, avoiding need for resexit and getexit.
# Setexit works as before, but getexit adds pointer
# to the saved block when it pushes saved state onto stack. 
# resexit restores this link by moving back extra word.
# getexit and setexit are to be thought of as an (almost) unitary action.
